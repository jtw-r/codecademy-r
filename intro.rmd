# Results in "500"
573 - 74 + 1

# Results in "50"
25 * 2

# Results in "2"
10 / 5

# Calculation:
25 * 4 + 9 / 3

# This is a comment!

## [Data Types] ##
class(2) # numeric -- any number
class('hello') # character -- any grouping of characters, sometimes refered to as a string
class('23') # character
class(FALSE) # logical -- two possible values, TRUE or FALSE, sometimes called a boolean
# vectors -- a list of related data, that is all the same type
class(NA) # logical -- NA represents the absence of a value

print('Jonathan')
print(18)
print('18')


## [Variables] ##
# assignment opperator: <-
full_name <- 'Jonathan Reiterman'

name <- 'Jonathan'
age <- 18


## [Vectors] ##
spring_months <- c("March", "April", "May", "June")
# Check the type of the elements in the vector
typeof(spring_months)
# Check the length of the vector
length(spring_months)
# Access individual elements
print(spring_months[2]) # start counting from 1, not 0

phone <- c(123, 456, 7890)


## [Conditionals] ##
message <- "I change based on a condition."

if (TRUE) {
  message <- 'I execute this when true!'
} else {
  message <- 'I execute this when false!'
}

print(message)


## [Comparison Operators] ##
# Less than: <
# Greater than: >
# Less than or equal to: <=
# Greater than or equal to: >=
# Is equal to: ==
# Is NOT equal to: !=

56 >= 129 # False

56 != 129 # True


## [Logical Operators] ##
# The AND operator: &
# The OR operator: |
# The NOT/bang operator: !

message <- 'Should I pack an umbrella?'
weather <- 'cloudy'
high_chance_of_rain <- TRUE

if (weather == 'cloudy' & high_chance_of_rain) {
  message <- 'Pack umbrella!'
} else {
  message <- 'No need for umbrella'
}

print(message) # Pack umbrella


## [Calling Functions] ##
data <- c(120,22,22,31,15,120)
unique_vals <- unique(data) # unique() returns values that don't have any duplicates
print(unique_vals) # 120  22  31  15

solution <- sqrt(49)
print(solution) # 7

round_down <- floor(3.14)
round_up <- ceiling(3.14)
print(round_down) # 3
print(round_up) # 4


## [Packages] ##
# To install a package:
#   install.packages('package-name')
# You only need to run that once
# To import a package:
#   library(package-name)
